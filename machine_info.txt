AEON virtual Machine Info:
The virtual machine contains an image of the standard Ubuntu 19.10 installation. Both username and password is set to aeon. 

To reliably run the machine, we recommend to assign at least two CPUs and 4GB of RAM (although a smaller number might be sufficient
for most small benchmarks) to the machine.

The instructions for the evaluators can be found in the virtual machine at location /home/aeon/ARTEFACT_README.txt
or at link http://biodivine.fi.muni.cz/aeon/ARTEFACT_README.txt

The image was prepared on a macOS host machine with 4 cores and 16GB of RAM.
